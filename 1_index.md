Biography
=========

My name is Tianyi Hao (郝天一). Welcome to my homepage!

I received my Ph.D. degree on computer science from the [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in 2021. I was working as an intern in Big Data Lab, Baidu Research from 2015 to 2017.

Before that, I have finished my undergraduate study in [Yao class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/) at Tsinghua, and received my B.S. degree in July 2014.
