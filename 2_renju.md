About me
========

I am a player and enthusiast in Renju and Gomoku, or the so-called _Wuziqi_ in China. Although I started to play renju when I was very young, there have been only a few years since I started to play in formal tournaments in 2013. In 2017, I obtained my first national champion title by winning the National University Championship, and was awarded the ranking of 4 dan.

I am glad to communicate and make friends with Renju fans all over the world. This is [my home page](https://www.renju.net/people/100753/) on [RenjuNet](https://www.renju.net/).
